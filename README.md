# I2C-Slave-to-Read-write-8-bit-of-data-
I2C combines the best features of SPI and UARTs. With I2C, you can connect multiple slaves to a single master (like SPI) and you can have multiple masters controlling single, or multiple slaves. This is really useful when you want to have more than one microcontroller logging data to a single memory card or displaying text to a single LCD. Like UART communication, I2C only uses two wires to transmit data between devices:   SDA (Serial Data) – The line for the master and slave to send and receive data. SCL (Serial Clock) – The line that carries the clock signal. I2C is a serial communication protocol, so data is transferred bit by bit along a single wire (the SDA line).
